#network_tools

###This repository holds sample code for a number of network tools implemented with python.


*Feb 10th, 2015* - Added a echo server and client with test functionality in Python.
                   This server will reprint what the client sent and then will give back
                   the message to the server telling it what it said.

*Feb 15th, 2015* - Added the HTTP1 portion of the assignment, such that the server requires
                   a correctly formatted phrase in order to give the right response, and
                   will send a proper error if it is not written correctly.

*Feb 15th, 2015* - Added the HTTP2 portion of the assignment, such that the server can take
                   requests for specific directories and look inside the files. Will work
                   with all file types and gives proper error if file does not exist.
